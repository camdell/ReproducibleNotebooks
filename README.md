# Reproducible Reports from Jupyter

## Description

Have you ever opened a collaborator’s notebook only to realize it won’t run on
your machine, half the cells are out of order, or the diff looks like a digital
ransom note? Notebooks are great for exploration, but they can easily drift
into something that’s hard to reproduce, hard to review, and even harder to
share.

In this session, we’re going to look at a practical, modern workflow for
*actually* making notebooks reproducible. We’ll set up reliable environments
with **Pixi**, use **Jupyter** in a clean, consistent way, sync notebooks to
text with **Jupytext**, and even automate checks and execution with **GitHub
Actions**. The goal: notebooks you can trust, rerun, version-control, and
confidently hand to a collaborator (or your future self).

## Agenda

- Why notebooks are hard to reproduce
- How to create reliable, shareable environments with Pixi
- How to run notebooks reproducibly with Jupyter
- How to automate execution and validation using GitHub Actions
- Why notebooks are hard to collaborate with
- How to keep notebooks clean and consistent with Jupytext
