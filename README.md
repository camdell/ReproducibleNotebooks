# Reproducible Reports from Jupyter

## Description

Have you ever tried to share a notebook with a collaborator only to find that
it doesn’t render correctly or that diffs are impossible to read? Messy outputs
and mixed code and narrative make reproducible reporting difficult.

Today, we’ll show how to convert notebooks into clean,
text-based formats using **Jupytext**. This allows notebooks to be
version-controlled effectively, keeps them readable, and supports reproducible,
publication-ready workflows.

## Agenda

- Why makes notebooks hard to reproduce?
- What makes notebooks hard to collaborate with?
- How can I make sure my notebooks run reliably?
